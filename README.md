# Receipt Reader

## Overview
Receipt Reader is an ongoing research project focused on accurately scanning grocery items and their corresponding prices from receipts into structured data. The primary goal is to develop an intuitive interface that enables roommates to easily split grocery bills.

## Current Implementation
The project includes three reader scripts and a collection of test receipt images:

1. **Reader Script 1**: Utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from receipts.
2. **Reader Script 2**: Currently not useful; serves as a testing framework.
3. **Reader Script 3**: Implements the AdamCodd DonutModel from Hugging Face, specifically designed for receipt data extraction in order to research how we could make our own model

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ReceiptReader.git
   cd ReceiptReader
